Alright! Let's create a more complex scenario with multiple tables that require various SQL operations, including JOINs, to retrieve information. I'll provide you with a fictional scenario, tables with sample data, and questions to answer using SQL.

### **Scenario: "The Art Museum Mystery"**:

An ancient artifact goes missing from a city's renowned art museum. The detective division creates a SQLite database to keep track of everyone involved, and clues related to the case.

**Tables & Sample Data**:

1. `Employees` (museum employees details)
    - Columns: `employeeID, firstName, lastName, position`

    | employeeID | firstName | lastName | position       |
    |------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
    | 1          | John      | Doe      | Security       |
    | 2          | Emily     | Smith    | Curator        |
    | 3          | Alan      | White    | Guide          |

2. `Visitors` (details about visitors on the day of the theft)
    - Columns: `visitorID, firstName, lastName, countryOfOrigin`

    | visitorID | firstName | lastName | countryOfOrigin |
    |-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
    | 1         | Michael   | Brown    | USA             |
    | 2         | Sarah     | Green    | UK              |
    | 3         | Felix     | Gray     | Germany         |

3. `Suspects` (details about the prime suspects)
    - Columns: `suspectID, type (Visitor/Employee), typeID (the ID from either Visitor or Employee table), reason`

    | suspectID | type     | typeID | reason                |
    |-----------|----------|--------|-----------------------|
    | 1         | Visitor  | 2      | Found near crime scene|
    | 2         | Employee | 1      | Previous theft record |

4. `Clues` (clues found at the museum)
    - Columns: `clueID, description, foundByEmployeeID`

    | clueID | description              | foundByEmployeeID |
    |--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
    | 1      | A torn piece of paper    | 3                 |
    | 2      | A silver pendant         | 1                 |

### **Questions**:

1. Retrieve the names of all suspects and their reasons for suspicion.
2. Find out the total number of visitors from each country on the day of the theft.
3. Identify which employee found the most clues.
4. List the clues found by John Doe.
5. Which position in the museum had the most employees listed as suspects?
6. Get a list of all employees who havenâ€™t found any clues.
7. Were there more visitor suspects or employee suspects?
8. Identify the country of origin of all visitor suspects.
9. List the reasons why employees were suspected.
10. Which clues were found by employees holding the position of "Guide"?

### **Answers** (SQL Commands):

1. 
```sql
SELECT firstName, lastName, reason 
FROM (
    SELECT firstName, lastName, reason FROM Visitors v
    JOIN Suspects s ON v.visitorID = s.typeID AND s.type = 'Visitor'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT firstName, lastName, reason FROM Employees e
    JOIN Suspects s ON e.employeeID = s.typeID AND s.type = 'Employee'
);
```

2. 
```sql
SELECT countryOfOrigin, COUNT(visitorID) 
FROM Visitors 
GROUP BY countryOfOrigin;
```

3. 
```sql
SELECT firstName, lastName, COUNT(clueID) as totalClues 
FROM Employees e 
JOIN Clues c ON e.employeeID = c.foundByEmployeeID 
GROUP BY foundByEmployeeID 
ORDER BY totalClues DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

4. 
```sql
SELECT description 
FROM Clues 
WHERE foundByEmployeeID = (SELECT employeeID FROM Employees WHERE firstName='John' AND lastName='Doe');
```

5. 
```sql
SELECT position, COUNT(suspectID) 
FROM Employees e 
JOIN Suspects s ON e.employeeID = s.typeID AND s.type = 'Employee' 
GROUP BY position 
ORDER BY COUNT(suspectID) DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

6. 
```sql
SELECT firstName, lastName 
FROM Employees 
WHERE employeeID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT foundByEmployeeID FROM Clues);
```

7. 
```sql
WITH EmployeeSuspects AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM Suspects WHERE type = 'Employee'),
VisitorSuspects AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM Suspects WHERE type = 'Visitor')
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN (SELECT count FROM EmployeeSuspects) > (SELECT count FROM VisitorSuspects) THEN 'Employees'
        ELSE 'Visitors'
    END AS MoreSuspects;
```

8. 
```sql
SELECT v.countryOfOrigin 
FROM Visitors v 
JOIN Suspects s ON v.visitorID = s.typeID AND s.type = 'Visitor';
```

9. 
```sql
SELECT reason 
FROM Suspects 
WHERE type = 'Employee';
```

10. 
```sql
SELECT description 
FROM Clues 
WHERE foundByEmployeeID IN (SELECT employeeID FROM Employees WHERE position = 'Guide');
```
